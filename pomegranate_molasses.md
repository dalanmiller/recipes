1. Remove the seeds from the pomegranate by the method explained.
2. The seeds now need to be crushed for their juice. I do this by pushing them through a fine sieve with the end of my wooden rolling pin.
3. They can be put in a food processor and pulsed lightly to start the process. (Do not overprocess them - if you start damaging the white seed within, the juice will be bitter.) Then place them in a sieve and push through. Once all the red juice is sperated from the seeds, discard the sieve contents. 
4. Place the juice in a heavy-based stainless-steel pan, bring to the boil and reduce very slowly until the mixture is syrupy and coats the back of a spoon. Place ina clean jar and keep refridgerated.
